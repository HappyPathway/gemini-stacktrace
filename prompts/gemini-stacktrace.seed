# Project Prompt: gemini-stacktrace
Pleaes help me create a script that will allow me to paste in a Python stack trace
and will leverage AI to search through the codebase, compile a collection of relevant code snippets
to submit to Gemini to help it figure out the plan of action in my codebase to fix.
needs to output a markdown file so that I can submit to CoPilot and have CoPilot Agent fix the code.

Solution must use:
- Pydantic-AI
- Pydantic Models
- MCP tools that the Gemini Agent can use to help figure out relevant code snippets

Need to research how an agent like this would work.

Please generate full plan and implementation details.
