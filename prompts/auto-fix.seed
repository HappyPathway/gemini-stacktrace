## Auto-Fix Implementation Extension Plan

1. **Code Modification Tools Integration**
   - Extend `CodebaseContext` class to include file modification methods:
     - `write_file(file_path, content)`: Write content to a file with safety checks
     - `backup_file(file_path)`: Create backup of file before modifications
     - `restore_backup(file_path)`: Restore file from backup if fix fails
     - `apply_diff(file_path, diff)`: Apply diff-format changes to a file

2. **Fix Detection Models**
   - Create Pydantic models to represent code fixes:
     - `CodeModification`: Represents a single change to a file
     - `FileFix`: Groups related changes to a single file
     - `FixPlan`: Collection of all fixes across multiple files
   - Include validation to ensure fixes are safe and well-formed

3. **LLM Response Parsing**
   - Enhance response parsing from Gemini to extract structured code fixes
   - Support multiple formats:
     - Unified diff format
     - Before/after code blocks
     - Line-by-line replacement instructions

4. **Fix Application Engine**
   - Create a `FixApplicator` class that:
     - Safely applies changes to files
     - Handles line number adjustments for multi-part changes
     - Manages atomic writes and backups
     - Validates that files remain syntactically valid after changes

5. **Testing Integration**
   - Add hooks to run tests or linters after applying changes:
     - Run specific tests affected by the changes
     - Use isolated environment to verify fixes before committing
     - Support for popular test frameworks (pytest, unittest)

6. **Version Control Integration**
   - Add optional integration with Git:
     - Create branch for fix attempt
     - Commit changes with descriptive message about the fix
     - Revert changes if tests fail
     - Support creating a PR with the fix

7. **Failure Recovery System**
   - Implement robust failure handling:
     - File backups before any modifications
     - Transaction-like approach to multi-file changes
     - Ability to roll back partially applied fixes
     - Detailed logging of all actions taken

8. **User Interaction Enhancements**
   - Create UI components for code review:
     - Diff viewer for proposed changes
     - Multi-step approval process for complex fixes
     - Edit capabilities before applying fixes
     - Detailed explanation of each change

9. **Fix Quality Assurance**
   - Add validation steps before changes are applied:
     - Syntax checking for modified code
     - Style consistency verification
     - Control flow analysis to detect potential issues
     - Ensure imports remain valid

10. **Remediation Report Generation**
    - Generate comprehensive report after fix attempt:
      - Summary of changes applied
      - Before/after code snippets
      - Test results
      - Recommendations for further improvements

**Considerations:**
- Always require user confirmation before applying changes.
- Use standard diff format for clarity.
- Ensure changes are idempotent and safe.
- Start with common error types and expand coverage iteratively.

**Considerations (continued):**
- Ensure atomicity and safety when modifying files.
- Provide clear logs and rollback options for all automated changes.
